## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was just a quick project to brush up on my frontend as i'm currently learning backend with GO and postgres. But i was reminded some css properties i had totally forgotten how to use

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
dismiss.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  success.style.display = "none";
  newsLetter.style.display = "flex";
  error.style.display = "none";
  user.value = "";
});
```
I know this is a very easy javascript coe, but something about it clashed with my css and i was able to tweak it to remove that error so yeah i'm very proud of this code


### Continued development
I'm currently working on an E-commerce wproject which wa sone of frontendmentors most challenging projects and it has driven me to go learn a topic i thought i wasn't ready for...data structures and algorithms. So that's what I'm trying to master right now, I'll tackle other projects too though
